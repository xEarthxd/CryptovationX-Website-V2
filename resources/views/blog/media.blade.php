        <p class="article-text">Since CryptovationX was founded, the company has rapidly gained a widespread media coverage including TV, newspaper,
            online media, and press conferences.
            <br>
            <br> Pondet Ananchai, CEO, was interviewed by Thai National News (TNN) on the cryptocurrency regulations in China.
            As the market went down and many investors had lost their fortune, we had spotted more arbitraging opportunities.
            By arbitraging, it does not matter if a market goes up or down, as long as there is asymmetric price on different
            exchange.
<br><br>
            On February 12th, Pondet was invited to live interview on TNN24 along with Dr. Bhume Bhumiratana, technology advisor to SEC Thailand. The program involved discussions around the topic of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency on various aspects: regulations, investments, and recommendations for Thailand. 
                <br><br>

Three-days later, Cryptovation hosted the ICO launch press conference and introduced CXA as the cryptocurrency for Robo-advisory and ‘Wealth for All’ Initiative at Intercontinental Hotel. The event involved discussions about blockchain, cryptocurrency, ICO, Artificial Intelligence, and the future investment opportunities.
<br><br>
CryptovationX was also published on Bangkok Post, the leading English newspaper in Thailand, about the ICO launch which quickly gained popularity among cryptocurrency and blockchain community in Thailand.
