        <p class="article-text">In early 2017, Cryptovation had begun piloting an Asset Management business model through arbitraging cryptocurrency, mainly by observing trends and price differences between exchanges and then conducting trades that yield a profit. The arbitrage concept was very successful as the market was quite volatile and lack of synchronised information. The team then sought to develop some form of automatic system, later known as ‘Arbot’, to report arbitrage opportunities so that it was possible to take advantage of every profitable opportunity without manual calculations and speeding up transaction windows.
<br><br>
By mid 2017, ‘Arbot’ was redesigned and improved for public use and we began plans to organize workshops and share knowledge on cryptocurrency. Cryptovation started gaining media attention and was featured several times on television network such as Thai National Network (TNN). It was also around this time where we achieved several milestones such as reaching 100,000 USD in assets under management. We also joined the Thai FinTech Challenge organized by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in Thailand and came up as one of the finalists for the event. The company had also been inducted into Thai FinTech Association for their sandbox opportunities as a FinTech Startup.
<br><br>
Late 2017 was quite productive for Cryptovation. We had established a partnership with AVA Advisory and Omicron Lab to work on Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and development for cryptocurrency speculative trading. We also partner with the professional financial firm, Asia Wealth Group, to advice us for a better structure and governance. Cryptovation had an opportunity to present at Asian Development Bank (ADB)’s 2nd Asia Finance Forum, and went to Hong Kong for meeting with InvestHK. By the end of December, Cryptovation had 800,000 USD asset under management.
<br><br>
The first months of 2018, Cryptovation was preparing for exhibition at Asia Digital Expo and the preparation of ICO Launch for AI Robo-advisory development crowdsale. Cryptovation had meetings with Bitotem and QCP Capital to partner, and had built collaboration with MIT Asia School of Business. Pondet, CEO, served as a moderator for Bangkok FinTech Fair 2018 as well as meetings with ZCoin, OmiseGo and BitHumb. Cryptovation also had an opportunity to engage with global Blockchain community at Asia Pacific Ethereum Meetup in Bangkok, Beyond Blocks in Tokyo, as well as in World Blockchain Conference 3AM Summit in Macau.
