			The following Terms and Conditions govern the creation and distribution of cryptographically secured digital tokens (CXA)
			operating on the Ethereum blockchain and issued by CryptovationX LLC (CryptovationX) for use in connection with the CryptovationX
			Platform as well as the sale of CXA to third party individuals and entities (each, a Contributor) in the private sale
			event (Private Token Sale):

		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="more2">
			1. Private Token Sale Principles
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			1.1 CryptovationX is currently developing an automated advisory platform (CryptovationX Platform) that is accessible to first-time
			users and addresses issues with existing exchanges, as described in the CryptovationX Platform Whitepaper (the Whitepaper).
			By transferring funds (Funds) in either cryptocurrency or fiat to CryptovationX pursuant to these Terms in order to contribute
			to the development of the CryptovationX Platform (Contribution), the Contributor understands and accepts that his/her/its
			Contribution will be utilized to enable further development of the CryptovationX Platform (as determined in CryptovationX’s
			sole discretion).
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			1.2 CXA tokens are being sold to Contributors on an invite-only basis and are not being offered to the public. Nevertheless,
			CryptovationX reserves the right to alter these Terms and offer CXA tokens to the general public at any time at its discretion.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			1.3 Further information on the CryptovationX Platform can be found in the Whitepaper available on the CryptovationX website
			(http://cryptovationx.io). The information contained in the Whitepaper and the CryptovationX website are of a descriptive
			nature only, are not binding and do not form part of the Terms as set forth under paragraph 1.6 below.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			1.4 Before being eligible to participate in the Private Token Sale, each Contributor must undergo an identification (KYC)
			and anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing (AML/CTF) process (KYC process). The instructions shall be
			communicated to the Contributor upon agreement to these Terms. After the KYC process has been completed, CryptovationX
			will allow the Contributor to transfer Funds to the CryptovationX within the Private Token Sale Period. The terms governing
			the funding process are set out in more detail in Section 2.2.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			1.5 The Contributor understands and accepts that CryptovationX may in its sole discretion determine to accept contributions
			from private entities and individuals of strategic value for the CryptovationX Platform, and that such contributions may
			be accepted at terms that differ from these Terms.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			1.6 The Contributor understands and accepts that while the individuals and entities, including CryptovationX, assigned to
			this task will make reasonable efforts to develop and complete the CryptovationX Platform, it is possible that such development
			may fail and Contributor’s CXA tokens become useless and/or valueless due to technical, commercial, regulatory or any
			other reasons (see also section 8 regarding Risks).
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			1.7 The Contributor understands and accepts the risk that even if all or parts of the CryptovationX Platform are successfully
			developed and released in full or in parts, the CryptovationX Platform could be fully or partially abandoned, remain commercially
			unsuccessful or be shut down for lack of interest, regulatory or other reasons. The Contributor therefore understands
			and accepts that the Contribution of Funds, the creation and allocation of CXA tokens by CryptovationX carry significant
			financial, regulatory and/or reputational risks (including the complete loss of value of CXA (if any), and attributed
			features of the CryptovationX Platform).
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			1.8 This document or any other materials provided by CryptovationX or relating to the CryptovationX Platform do not constitute
			a prospectus of any sort, is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities
			in any jurisdiction. Neither this document nor any other materials have been (or will be) registered as a prospectus with
			any governmental authorities.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			1.9 The Contributor furthermore understands and accepts that the CXA token is smart-contract based. Consequently, the smart
			contract contains code which sets forth further terms and conditions applicable to the distribution and operation of the
			CXA token. The direct address(es) of the smart contract code on the Ethereum blockchain shall be made available upon request.
			The terms and conditions set forth in the smart contract code are incorporated by this reference and constitute part of
			these Terms. To the extent the terms contained herein or in any other document or communication contradict the ones set
			forth in the smart contract code, the terms of the smart contract code shall prevail. The functionality of the CXA token
			is defined by the smart contract code only. Furthermore, neither this document nor any other document or communication
			may modify or add any additional obligations to CryptovationX beyond those set forth in the smart contract code.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			1.10 Transfer of Funds, allocation, distribution or receipt of CryptovationX, or any other act undertaken between the parties
			in connection with the Private Token Sale shall not form a partnership, joint venture or any similar relationship between
			the Contributor and CryptovationX and/or other individuals or entities involved with the deployment of the CryptovationX
			Platform and the setting up of the CryptovationX Platform.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			1.11 The Contributor acknowledges and understands that CryptovationX may at its discretion at any time change the name of
			the CXA token and/or its symbol. CryptovationX shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that such change of name and/or
			symbol will not adversely affect the rights of the Contributors or the CXA held by the Contributors.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="more2">
			2. Usage Token; No Ownership, Revenue or Governance Rights
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			2.1 Usage Token: Ownership of CXA carries no rights express or implied other than a limited right to use CXA as a means to
			enable usage of and interaction with and within the CryptovationX Platform, if and to the extent the CryptovationX Platform
			has been successfully completed and launched.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			2.2 No Ownership, Revenue or Governance Rights: In particular, Contributor understands and accepts that CXA does not represent
			or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security or equivalent rights nor any right to receive future revenues,
			shares or any other form of participation or governance right in or relating to the CryptovationX Platform. CXA does not
			create or confer any enforceable contractual or other obligations against any third party (including CryptovationX, CryptovationX
			Team Members or other developers, auditors, contractors or founders associated with CXA, the CryptovationX Platform and/or
			CryptovationX).
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="more2">
			3. Contribution
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			3.1 Digital Asset Purchase Agreement: the Contributor must enter into an agreement to purchase CXA tokens from CryptovationX
			subject to both these Terms and the terms of the aforementioned agreement.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			3.2 Maximum Contribution Amount: The aggregate maximum Contribution amount for the entire allocation of CXA (throughout the
			Private Token Sale) will be defined as a hard cap and amounts to $21,600,000 USD (excluding fees arising from or related
			to the contribution process), calculated using the exchange rates as determined by CryptovationX (Maximum Contribution
			Amount). CryptovationX may, at its discretion, determine that the Maximum Contribution Amount is reached when the aggregate
			amount of Funds transferred to the CryptovationX Platform is close to the Maximum Contribution Amount, even though the
			actual amount of Contributions accepted by the CryptovationX Platform would be less than the Maximum Contribution Amount
			(e.g. if the aggregate amount of Contributions does not sum up to exactly the Maximum Contribution Amount).
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			3.3 Maximum CXA Supply: The aggregate maximum CXA supply (as set out in paragraph 3.6) will be 12,000,000,000 CXA. The aggregate
			amount of CXA will depend on the effectively made Contributions during the Private Token Sale and will be referred to
			as total CXA supply (Total CXA Supply).
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			3.4 Contribution Period: The Private Token Sale period (Private Token Sale Period) starts on [●] and continues for a period
			of four (4) weeks or the moment when the Maximum Contribution Amount has been reached, whichever occurs earlier.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			3.5 Contribution and Exchange Rates: The contribution rate in the Private Token Sale shall be 1 CXA for every Contribution
			equivalent to $0.003 USD. The BTC/USD and ETH/USD exchange rate to be used throughout the Private Token Sale shall be
			real-time rate on Coinmarketcap (https://coinmarketcap.com) during the commencement of the Private Token Sale Period.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			3.6 Token Pools: The allocation of CXA will be determined as set out below. The Contributors Contributing in the Private
			Token Sale will be distributed CXA from Pool A. The aggregate amount of CXA that will be distributed from Pool A at the
			end of the Private Token Sale Period will depend on how much Funds are Contributed.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(a) Pool A consists of 7,200,000,000 CXA (i.e. 60% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool A includes all CXA tokens that shall be
			sold by CryptovationX to Contributors during the Private Token Sale Period.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(b) Pool B consists of 4,800,000,000 CXA (i.e. 40% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool B will be allocated and distributed at
			the discretion of CryptovationX, such as for allocation, sale and/or distribution to persons who participated as managers,
			founders or team members, or worked to develop the ideas, implementations and supporting structures of the CryptovationX
			Platform or to airdrop or bounty campaigns, or for any other purpose as CryptovationX deems fit etc.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			3.7 Contribution Process: Upon signing an agreement with CryptovationX, Contributors shall transfer their Funds to CryptovationX
			in the amount and to the address and/or bank account as provided in the aforementioned agreement.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			3.8 Distribution of CXA to Contributors: Upon receipt and acceptance of a Contributor’s Contribution, the CryptovationX shall
			allocate the corresponding amount of CXA to the Contributor’s cryptographic wallet address once the Private Token Sale
			Period is complete. The CXA will be nontransferable until they are released as set out in paragraph 3.11.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			3.9 Undistributed tokens: Any CXA in Pool A that have been created but for which no Contribution has ultimately been received
			shall be allocated to CryptovationX and shall be further disposed of at CryptovationX’s discretion for purposes of the
			long-term benefit of the CryptovationX Platform.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			3.10 No Refund: The Contributor understands and accepts that all Contributions are final and may not be refunded. By participating
			in the Private Token Sale, the Contributor acknowledges that he/she/it has no right to request a refund for any reason,
			and that the Contributor will not receive money or other compensation. CryptovationX shall not be liable for any losses
			caused by the Contributor attempting to use a private wallet address provided by an exchange, or other non- standard single
			access address.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			3.11 Transferability of CXA: The Contributors will not be able to transfer CXA until the Private Token Sale Period is complete.
			CXA transferability will be released at CryptovationX’s discretion when the Private Token Sale Period is over and all
			CXA have been allocated and distributed; the process is currently expected to take a few weeks after the conclusion of
			the Private Token Sale Period. The CXA in Pool B shall become transferable at such time as determined by CryptovationX
			in its full discretion.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			3.12 Pre-Allocation of CryptovationX
		</p>
		<p class="more1">

			of the Private Token Sale but as set forth below:
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(1) Pool B consists of 4,800,000,000 CXA (i.e. 40% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool B will be allocated and distributed at
			the discretion of CryptovationX, such as for allocation, sale and/or distribution to persons who participated as managers,
			founders or team members, or worked to develop the ideas, implementations and supporting structures of the CryptovationX
			Platform or to airdrop or bounty campaigns, or for any other purpose as CryptovationX deems fit etc.

			or equivalent rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the CryptovationX Platform and/or CXA. Through
			the allocation of CXA to a Contributor, the Contributor receives no right to receive any revenues generated by the intellectual
			property rights developed as part of the CryptovationX Platform or any other assets. The Contributor understands and agrees

			work which may result in significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release. The Contributor understands
			and accepts that as part of the development, an upgrade of the CXA token may be required (a so-called hard-fork of the
			CXA token) and that, if the Contributor decides not to participate in such upgrade, he/she/it may no longer use his CXA
			and that any non-upgraded CXA may lose their functionality in full.

		<p class="more2">
			8. Audit of the CryptovationX Platform
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			8.1 The CryptovationX Platform has been, on a reasonable effort basis, audited and approved by a technical expert. The technical
			expert has confirmed that the CryptovationX Platform has, with regard to both accuracy and security, been programmed according
			to the current state of the art.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			8.2 However, the Contributor understands and accepts that blockchain technology is still in an early development stage and
			its application of experimental nature which carries significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory and
			reputational risks. Accordingly, while the audit conducted raises the level of security and accuracy, the Contributor
			understands and accepts that the audit does not amount to any form of warranty, including direct or indirect warranties
			that the CryptovationX Platform and/or the CXA are fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities
			or bugs which could cause, inter alia, the complete loss of Funds and/or CXA.
		</p>
		<p class="more2">
			9. Risks
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			9.1 The Contributor understands and accepts the risks associated with contributing Funds to the Private Token Sale and the
			creation and distribution of CXA as exemplary set forth above and hereinafter. In particular, the Contributor understands
			and accepts the non-exhaustive list of inherent risks:
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(a) Risk of software weaknesses: The underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the CryptovationX Platfo
			unproven, and there are no warranties or covenants that the process for creating or distributing CXA will be uninterrupted
			or error-free and why there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing,
			inter alia, the complete loss of Funds and/or CXA.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(b) Risk of cryptographic weaknesses: The blockchain and all software dependent thereon, such as the CryptovationX Platform
			are based on the effectiveness and reliability of cryptographic solutions. However, cryptography is evolving and cannot
			guarantee absolute security at all times. Advances in cryptography, such as code cracking, or technical advances such
			as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to all cryptography-based systems including the CryptovationX
			Platform. This could result in the theft, loss, disappearance, destruction or devaluation of the CXA held by the Contributor.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(c) Regulatory risk: The blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and it is possible that certain jurisdictions
			will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications,
			which may be contrary to the current setup of the CryptovationX Platform and which may, inter alia, result in substantial
			modifications of the CryptovationX Platform and/or the CryptovationX Platform, including its termination and the loss
			or devaluation of CXA held by the Contributor.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(d) Risk of insufficient information: The CryptovationX Platform is at a very early developmental stage and its philosophy,
			consensus mechanism, algorithm, code and other technical specifications and parameters could be updated and changed frequently
			and constantly. While the Whitepaper contains the up-to-date key information related to CXA at the date of the Whitepaper,
			it is not complete or final and is subject to adjustments and updates that CryptovationX may make from time to time. CryptovationX
			is not in a position, nor obliged, to keep the Contributors closely posted on every detail of the CryptovationX Platform’s
			development (including its progress and expected milestones, whether re- scheduled or not) and therefore will not necessarily
			provide the Contributors with timely or full access to all the information relating to the CryptovationX Platform that
			may emerge from time to time.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(e) Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The creation and distribution of the CXA and the development of the CryptovationX
			Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of
			commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). CXA is not expected to be popular, prevalent or widely
			used soon after its launch. CXA and the CryptovationX Platform may remain marginalized in the long run, appealing to only
			a minimal portion of users (if any). There is thus no assurance that, even if the CryptovationX Platform is partially
			or fully developed and launched, the Contributor will receive any benefits through the CXA tokens held by him/her/it.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(f) Risks related to unverified source code: The source code of the CryptovationX Platform may be licensed under open-source
			license terms and any party related or unrelated to the CryptovationX Platform can propose updates, amendments, alterations
			or modifications to the source code. CryptovationX may not be able to verify or guarantee the precise results of such
			updates, amendments, alterations or modifications and as a result, any update, amendment, alteration or modification could
			lead to an unexpected or unintended outcome that adversely affects the CryptovationX Platform or CXA value.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(g) Risks related to competition: The source code of the CryptovationX Platform may be licensed under open-source license
			terms. As a result, anyone can legally copy, replicate, reproduce, engineer, modify, improve or otherwise utilize the
			source code and/or underlying source code of the CryptovationX Platform in an attempt to develop a competing protocol,
			software, system or virtual platform or virtual machine, which is out of CryptovationX’s control and may consequently
			compete with or even overshadow or overtake the CryptovationX Platform, which may adversely affect the CryptovationX Platform
			or CXA value.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(h) Risk of withdrawing partners: The feasibility of the CryptovationX Platform depends strongly on the collaboration of
			banks and other crucial partners of CryptovationX. There is therefore no assurance that the CryptovationX Platform as
			a whole or parts thereof will be successfully executed as set out in these Terms or otherwise.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(i) Risk associated with other applications: The CryptovationX Platform may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted
			by unaffiliated third parties, under which CXA will have no intrinsic value.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(j) Risk of loss of private key: CXA can only be accessed by using a cryptographic wallet with a combination of the Contributor’s
			account information (address), private key, password and any other protection used by the Contributor. If the Contributor’s
			private key file, password or the back-up seed is lost or stolen, the CXA associated with the Contributor's account (address)
			or password may be unrecoverable and permanently lost.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(k) Third party risk: CryptovationX may engage third parties to manage and operate the Private Token Sale processes. CryptovationX
			has no visibility into, or possibility to control, the software or mechanisms used by such third parties, and cannot verify
			or guarantee the proper functionality of the third parties’ software or operations.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(l) Risk of theft: The CryptovationX Platform concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the
			CryptovationX Platform), or other assets of the CryptovationX Platform, may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other
			individuals that could result in theft or loss of CXA or Funds, which may lead to a loss or devaluation of Funds and/or
			CXA and the ability to develop the CryptovationX Platform.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(m) Risk of mining and other malicious attacks: As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the CryptovationX
			Platform is susceptible to mining and other malicious attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority
			mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the
			CryptovationX Platform, expected proper execution and sequencing of CryptovationX transactions, and expected proper execution
			and sequencing of contract computations.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(n) Risk of changes in the CryptovationX Platform: The network of miners (or, in the future, potentially a network of staking
			nodes) will be ultimately in control of the CryptovationX Platform. A majority of these miners could agree at any point
			to make changes to the CryptovationX Platform and to run the new version of the CryptovationX Platform, which could lead
			to reduced functionality of the CryptovationX Platform and/or devaluation of CXA.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(o) Risk of incompatible Wallet service: The cryptographic wallet software or wallet service provider of the Contributor
			must be technically compatible with CXA. The failure to assure this may lead to the Contributor being unable to gain access
			to his CXA.

		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="more2">
			10. Taxation
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			10.1 The Contributor bears the sole responsibility to determine if the Contribution to the CryptovationX Platform; the creation,
			allocation, ownership and use of CXA or the purchase and thereof after allocation and distribution; the potential appreciation

			and the Contributor agrees not to seek to hold them liable, for the conduct of third parties and that the risk of receiving,
			holding, transferring and using CXA rests entirely with the Contributor.
		</p>

		<p class="more1">
			11.3 By receiving, holding, transferring or using CXA, and to the extent permitted by law, the Contributor agrees not to
			hold any third party (including CryptovationX Team Members and other developers, auditors, contractors or founders associated
			with CXA, the CryptovationX Platform, the CryptovationX Platform and/or CryptovationX) liable for any regulatory implications
			or liability associated with or arising from the creation, allocation, distribution, ownership or use of CXA or any other
			action or transaction related to the CryptovationX Platform.
